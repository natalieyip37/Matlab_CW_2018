-- FILES BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS --


- FUNCTIONS -

- comp_press_field_point_source.m -
This function computes the pressure field generated by an acoustic point source as a function of time over a 3D grid of sample points.

- comp_Gaussian_tone_burst.m -
This function computes a normalised Gaussian tone burst for arbitrary input of centre frequency, standard deviation, and temporal step size.
Using approximation: -4*stdev <= t <= 4*stdev



- SCRIPTS -

- script_Task1.m -
Using function comp_press_field_point_source to compute the pressure at grid point (x,y,z) = (1,1,0) mm for all time sample 0<=t<=3 ms
using a temporal step size of delta_t = 10 ns.

- script_Task2.m -
Using function comp_Gaussian_tone_burst to compute a Gaussian tone burst for a specified set of parameters.
Using approximation to the Gaussian: -4*stdev <= t <= 4*stdev

- script_Task3.m -
Incorporating a Gaussian tone burst into the acoustic field simulations.
To simulate a linear filter that suppresses those frequency components not present in the pulse shape of finite duration in time.

- script_Task4.m -
1. To compute the amplitude spectrum S(f) of s(x,y,z,t) from Task 3, and plot this spectrum as a function of frequency f.
2. Vary values of centre frequency and standard deviation, compute s(x,y,z,t) for these values, plot resulting amplitude spectrum
in the same figure in different panels.

- script_Task5.m -
To compute the pressure generated by an acoustic point source across an extended xy-plane.

- script_Task6.m -
Extend similation to acoustic sources of finite dimensions, using the Huygen's principle.

- script_Task7.m -
Measuring the variation in the accuracy of the similation performed for Task 6 as a function of the separation distance between
the point sources. The accuracy is computed using the normalised rms error.
